This is a Zombie game written by C++. 
Inheritance and STL(vector) are mainly used to duplicate 
the properties of the characters(dumb Zombie, smart Zombie, Citizen, Player, Items and so on).
All the base data can be disposed with txt file (location of zombies, walls, citizen, items, and player) and, 
based on the data, the game can be played in 256*256 pixels. 
The goal of the game is to make all citizens escape from the map. 
There are 4 items: fire gun charger, ground mine, and Vaccine.
The player can kill the zombie with the items by shooting fire, installed mine, 
and a pit (generated by exploded a mine).

Smart Zombies are following Citizens and players and can vomit. 
The vomit would be a cause to get infection of human. 
The infected condition will be stayed for 500 ticks and after the time, the citizen will change to Zombie. 
If a player having an infection like that, it results in the lost of life.
